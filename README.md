Test Shopbridge_base Application ready to deploy once you are created database using Code first and replaced some setting ConnectionString with Your DB Connections
Currently I'm using Postgress sql server as a database but you can easily chose another database by change connectionstring and UseSQLServer or UseInMemory Or UseMySql etc.
Thank you.
